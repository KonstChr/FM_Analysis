# FM Assessment
"Sorting Clients by Frequency and Monetary value for more effective targeting "

This project was given to me as a Data Challenge where I was specifically requested to upload my solutions in a public depository.
Also, I am well aware the technique is RFM Analysis but the Project task was only for Frequency and Monetary.
I don't own the data. The only thing mine is the code and this notebook is only here to showcase my code-writing style and skills

Skills Demonstrated: Analytics, RFM (Not exploring Recency was in the Data Challenge description), Pareto's Principle
